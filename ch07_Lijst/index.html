            The "Flower of Life" can be found in all major religions of the world. It contains the 
            patterns of creation as they emerged from the "Great Void". Everything is made from the 
            Creator's thought. After the creation of the Seed of Life the same vortex's motion was 
            continued, creating the next structure known as the Egg of Life. This structure forms 
            the basis for music, as the distances between the spheres is identical to the distances 
            between the tones and the half tones in music. It is also identical to the cellular 
            structure of the third embryonic division (The first cell divides into two cells, then 
            to four cells then to eight). Thus this same structure as it is further developed, creates 
            the human body and all of the energy systems including the ones used to create the Merkaba. 
            If we continue creating more and more spheres we will end up with the structure called the 
            Flower of Life. <a href="http://www.learnit.nl" target="_black">Learn More</a>
